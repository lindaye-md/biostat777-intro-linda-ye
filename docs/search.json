    "text": "The ChickWeight dataset is a built-in dataset in R that contains weight measurements of chicks on different diets over a period of time. The dataset includes the following variables:\n\nweight (numeric): The weight of the chick (in grams).\nTime (numeric): The time (in days) since the chick was hatched when the measurement was made.\nChick (ordinal): A unique identifier for each chick (between 18 and 48). The ordering of the levels groups chicks on the same diet together and orders them according to their final weight (lightest to heaviest) within diet.\nDiet (categorical): The diet type (1, 2, 3, or 4) assigned to the chick.\n\nThe data were collected from an experiment conducted by the Department of Agriculture in the 1930s to study the effects of different diets on the growth of chicks (Crowder and Hand 1990). The specific composition of each diet was:\n\nDiet 1: normal corn diet (control)\nDiet 2: corn diet with 10% protein\nDiet 3: corn diet with 20% protein\nDiet 4: corn diet with 40% protein\n\nEach chick was weighed at birth, every two days thereafter until day 20, and once more on day 21 (up to 12 time points).

Diet 3 had the highest estimated weight gain per day, followed by diets 4, 2, and then the control diet (1). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals around the estimates. All experimental diets showed statistically significant higher weight gain rates compared to the control diet after Bonferroni correction (p-value &lt; 0.001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, this was an analysis of the ChickWeight dataset, which measured the weights of chicks on four different diets at 12 timepoints from birth until day 21: control corn diet (1), diet with 10% protein replacement (2), diet with 20% protein replacement (3), and diet with 40% protein replacement (4) (Crowder and Hand 1990).\nFigure 3 demonstrates serial boxplots of the weight distribution of the chicks in each diet. At baseline (day 0), the average starting weights among all four groups are similar. Until day 14, the chicks on diet 4 appeared to have a higher absolute weight gain. After day 14, the average weight of the chicks on diet 3 surpassed that of the chicks on diet 4. This was supported by the calculations of absolute average weight gain between study start and the last measured weights, with diet 3 associated with the greatest average total weight gain (229.5 g) over the study period (Table 2). Linear regression analysis (Table 3) revealed that diet 3 (20% protein) had the highest estimated growth rate (11.4 g/day) among the diets, followed by diet 4 (40% protein), diet 2 (10% protein), and finally diet 1 (control). All experimental diets showed statistically significant higher weight gain rates compared to the control diet after Bonferroni correction (Table 3).\nNotably, diet 1 had the highest dropout rate (20%) by day 21, followed by a 10% dropout rate in diet 4, while diets 2 and 3 had no dropout over the study period (Table 1). The information available about the dataset is not detailed enough to hypothesize why this may be the case, however in Figure 2, several very low weight outliers are observed in diet 1 preceding subsequent dropout, suggesting that poor growth may have contributed to chick attrition. There is no clear explanation for the single dropout (n=1) observed in data 4.\nThe findings of this analysis is consistent with current guidelines recommending 23% crude protein in chick feeds for age 0-3 weeks (National Research Council (1994)):\n\n\n\nThe National Research Council (NRC) requires 23% crude protein in broiler chicks aged 0-3 weeks.

Table adapted by (Applegate and Angel 2008)\n\n\nIn addition, formulations of commercial chick starter feeds contain around 18-20% crude protein (see margin).\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial chick starter feed with 18% protein. Source: MannaPro, Amazon.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSince the original experiment performed in 1930 (from which the ChickWeight dataset is derived) and the peer-reviewed research (published between 1947-1991) incorporated into the NRC’s Nutrient Requirements of Poultry (1994), present-day broiler chicks are “very different from birds available prior to 1991, due in part to genetic selection as well as management practice and feed-related changes” (Applegate and Angel 2008).\nThus, current nutritional requirements may differ from those observed in this dataset and also from those recommended by the NRC. The NRC has since convened to update their recommendations with a 10th edition expected to be published in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr and tidyr:\ncount(), group_by(), mutate(), ungroup(), filter(), distinct(), summarise(), arrange(), pivot_wider(), select(), nest(), map(), unnest()\nggplot2:\nggplot(), aes(), geom_col(), scale_x_continuous(), geom_line(), scale_y_continuous(), labs(), geom_point(), geom_smooth(), geom_boxplot(), facet_wrap(), geom_errorbar()\n\n\n\nExpand to see code used:\n\n\nCode\n# data important & packages:\nchickwt = ChickWeight\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# data wrangling and analysis:\nchickwt_nday = chickwt |&gt;\n  count(Time, Diet) |&gt;\n  group_by(Diet) |&gt;\n  mutate(n0 = n[Time == min(Time)], retention = n / n0) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nchickcounts = as_tibble(chickwt) |&gt;\n  filter(Time %in% c(0, 21)) |&gt;\n  distinct(Diet, Time, Chick) |&gt;\n  count(Diet, Time, name = \"n_chicks\") |&gt;\n  arrange(Diet, Time)\n\nchickcounts = chickcounts |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = Time,\n    values_from = n_chicks,\n    names_prefix = \"day_\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    dropout = day_0 - day_21,\n    pct_dropout = dropout / day_0 * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(-dropout) |&gt;\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"Diet\", \"n (Day 0)\", \"n (Day 21)\", \"% Dropout\")\n  )\n\nchickwtgain = as_tibble(chickwt) |&gt;\n  group_by(Chick, Diet) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    w0 = weight[which.min(Time)],\n    wend = weight[which.max(Time)],\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(weightgain = wend - w0) |&gt;\n  summarise(avgwtgain = mean(weightgain), n_chicks = n(), .by = Diet) |&gt;\n  arrange(Diet) |&gt;\n  select(-n_chicks) |&gt;\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"Diet\", \"Avg Weight Gain (g)\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = \"center\")\n\nchickwt_lm = chickwt |&gt;\n  group_by(Diet) |&gt;\n  nest() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    model = map(data, ~ lm(weight ~ Time, data = .x, na.action = na.omit)),\n    tidied = map(model, ~ broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE))\n  ) |&gt;\n  unnest(tidied) |&gt;\n  filter(term == \"Time\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    p_bonf = p.adjust(p.value, method = \"bonferroni\"),\n    stars = case_when(\n      p_bonf &lt; 0.001 ~ \"***\",\n      p_bonf &lt; 0.01 ~ \"**\",\n      p_bonf &lt; 0.05 ~ \"*\",\n      TRUE ~ \"ns\"\n    )\n  )\n\nchickwt_lmtable = chickwt_lm |&gt;\n  select(-c(2, 3, 4, 8)) |&gt;\n  mutate(p_bonf = sprintf(\"%.3g\", p_bonf)) |&gt;\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Diet\",\n      \"Est.

The NRC has since convened to update their recommendations with a 10th edition expected to be published in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr and tidyr:\ncount(), group_by(), mutate(), ungroup(), filter(), distinct(), summarise(), arrange(), pivot_wider(), select(), nest(), map(), unnest()\nggplot2:\nggplot(), aes(), geom_col(), scale_x_continuous(), geom_line(), scale_y_continuous(), labs(), geom_point(), geom_smooth(), geom_boxplot(), facet_wrap(), geom_errorbar()\n\n\n\nExpand to see code used:\n\n\nCode\n# data important & packages:\nchickwt = ChickWeight\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# data wrangling and analysis:\nchickwt_nday = chickwt |&gt;\n  count(Time, Diet) |&gt;\n  group_by(Diet) |&gt;\n  mutate(n0 = n[Time == min(Time)], retention = n / n0) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nchickcounts = as_tibble(chickwt) |&gt;\n  filter(Time %in% c(0, 21)) |&gt;\n  distinct(Diet, Time, Chick) |&gt;\n  count(Diet, Time, name = \"n_chicks\") |&gt;\n  arrange(Diet, Time)\n\nchickcounts = chickcounts |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = Time,\n    values_from = n_chicks,\n    names_prefix = \"day_\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    dropout = day_0 - day_21,\n    pct_dropout = dropout / day_0 * 100\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(-dropout) |&gt;\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"Diet\", \"n (Day 0)\", \"n (Day 21)\", \"% Dropout\")\n  )\n\nchickwtgain = as_tibble(chickwt) |&gt;\n  group_by(Chick, Diet) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    w0 = weight[which.min(Time)],\n    wend = weight[which.max(Time)],\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(weightgain = wend - w0) |&gt;\n  summarise(avgwtgain = mean(weightgain), n_chicks = n(), .by = Diet) |&gt;\n  arrange(Diet) |&gt;\n  select(-n_chicks) |&gt;\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"Diet\", \"Avg Weight Gain (g)\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = \"center\")\n\nchickwt_lm = chickwt |&gt;\n  group_by(Diet) |&gt;\n  nest() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    model = map(data, ~ lm(weight ~ Time, data = .x, na.action = na.omit)),\n    tidied = map(model, ~ broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE))\n  ) |&gt;\n  unnest(tidied) |&gt;\n  filter(term == \"Time\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    p_bonf = p.adjust(p.value, method = \"bonferroni\"),\n    stars = case_when(\n      p_bonf &lt; 0.001 ~ \"***\",\n      p_bonf &lt; 0.01 ~ \"**\",\n      p_bonf &lt; 0.05 ~ \"*\",\n      TRUE ~ \"ns\"\n    )\n  )\n\nchickwt_lmtable = chickwt_lm |&gt;\n  select(-c(2, 3, 4, 8)) |&gt;\n  mutate(p_bonf = sprintf(\"%.3g\", p_bonf)) |&gt;\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Diet\",\n      \"Est.
