This website was created by Linda Ye, MD at the Department of Surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Master's candidate of clinical investigation at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The creation of this website was motivated by the Biostatistics 140.777 course, but all content (unless otherwise cited) belongs to the creator.

Through this activity, I have learned way more than a surgeon needs to know about poultry feed in a very short period of time.

The webpages were created and coded in Quarto using Rstudio (4.5.1) and Positron (Positron Version: 2025.10.1 (Universal) build 4) using R programming code, Unix, and CSS. Code debugging assistance and light tutorial was provided by HopGPT, maintained by the Johns Hopkins Data Sciences and AI Institute.
The site was deployed via GitHub Pages.
